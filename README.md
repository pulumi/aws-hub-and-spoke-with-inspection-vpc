# aws-hub-and-spoke-with-inspection-vpc

This repo contains a Pulumi program that creates a hub-and-spoke network architecture on AWS in Python. It is intended to serve as the basis for an eventual workshop to be delivered virtually in conjuction with AWS along with a self-guided option at <https://pulumi.awsworkshop.io/>.
