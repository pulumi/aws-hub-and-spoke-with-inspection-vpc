# aws-hub-and-spoke-with-inspection-vpc

**NOTE: This repo is a work in progress and likely ephemeral - it will probably be re-created or moved to another location.**

This repo contains a Pulumi program that creates a hub-and-spoke network architecture on AWS in Python. It is intended to serve as the basis for an eventual workshop to be delivered virtually in conjuction with AWS along with a self-guided option at <https://pulumi.awsworkshop.io/>.

The purpose of this repo is for gathering feedback before creating the self-guided workshop content. We want to get the code in a steady state because changes to the final workshop code involve significant rework to the self-guided content due to all of the interstitial instances of the code ("At this point, your code should look like this...").
